==============

Simple website using Django 1.5.1, SQLite3, and Bootstrap 2.3.2.

It consists of a very simple database and three views that help as a template to create a website:
  - Login View
  - Insert data into the database
  - Get data and visualize it


This project is free but, please, tell me if you use this template for any of your projects.
